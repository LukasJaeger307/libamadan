A free metaheuristics library for Rust.
## What are metaheuristics?
A heuristic is a strategy to find solutions for a specific problem that are not optimal but close to it. Ideally those solutions are found in way less time than exact solutions. A metaheuristic is a type of heuristic that is applicable to more than one problem.
## Where can metaheuristics be used
There is a large number of problems where it is inherently difficult to find an exact solution but a close-to-optimum solution will suffice. The traveling salesman problem is one example for such a problem. Many more can be found in the field of hardware synthesis: Scheduling, place-and-route and many more problems are solved heuristically.
