initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Hillclimbing","Hillclimbing is the most basic metaheuristic. It starts with a random solution, mutates it slightly and if it achieves a better fitness after mutation than before, it replaces the initial solution. This is re-iterated until a given maximum number of iterations is reached or if a given maximum number of failed iterations is exceeded. This metaheuristic has no way of avoiding local maxima. If it gets stuck in a local  maximum, it has no chance of ever leaving it again."]]});
